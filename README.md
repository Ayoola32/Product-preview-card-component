## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

- I was able to understand when and why do we use justify-content, align-items, min-max(width) and also min-max(height).

### Continued development

Currently learning the basic concepts of CSS and its properties. Afterward i would be diving into javascript and also choosing React and my framework, just to build more interactive project
